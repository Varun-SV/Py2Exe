Python Program with exe file to make any python file into an exe file.

# How to run the program
You can either run the exe file present in this git, by either downloading it or cloning this repository by running the following command `git clone https://github.com/Varun-SV/Py2Exe.git`.

Make sure the python file you want to convert is in a separate folder (Your files may get affected if not...)
Now, once written just press enter, and you will now have an executable ready for execution in the same directory as that of your python file.

Once, over the window will close itself and then you can check your ready file in your directory.
